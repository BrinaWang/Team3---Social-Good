    <!--- About --->
    <h2>Many pets are treated so poorly, taken advantage of, absued, or bre in a harmful way</h2>
    <p>Pets are such fundamental parts of many people's lives and homes, and knowing the real process that they are often put through before they make it into homes is vital. We should only support and promote organizations and centers that will continue to treat these animals with the love and care they deserve.
